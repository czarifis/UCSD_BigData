##About the eigen faces notebook

we've got 64 images. 64 is a space R^(20000) any of these 64 vectors can be represeted as a linear combination of the images. Images spane a 64 dimensional space. Any basis has at most 64 vectors.

As a reviewer I should add : 
** My name ** When you use 64 vectors it is mathematical guarenteed that you will get perfect recostruction of the image.
