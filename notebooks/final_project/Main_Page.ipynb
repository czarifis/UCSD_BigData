We will study the mean temperature of the whole world for the last 100 years. Besides that, we are also investigating the trend of the temperature difference and the average precipitation. In order to show global warming, we are monitoring the average temperature of one year and 10 years correspondingly, we can easily see that the temperture is increasing. Here is a quickshot of the station in Germany, specifically in **BAMBERG**. Clearly, in this station, we can see that the temperature is increasing, especially from 1980s.

      "\n",
      "In this section we experiment with the idea of partitioning the globe into rectangle \n",
      "shaped groups, based on a hierarchical partitioning (*k-d-tree*). The main invariant we wish to \n",
      "accomplish is that siblings (in our case **rectangle** areas) are close to each other \n",
      "and leaves have a similar \"weight\". Weight of an area in our case is the the total number \n",
      "of lines data that we have for stations in that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this partitioning:\n",
      " * We first divide the original area into two rectangle areas, such that the weight\n",
      "   in each area are roughly the same.\n",
      " * Then we descend into each one of these areas and perform the same thing recursively.\n",
      " * In each iteration we alternate the direction in which we do the split (i.e. longitude \n",
      "   and latitude)\n",
      "\n",
      "This process results in the partitioning of the world in rectangles of about the same\n",
      "total weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "After experimenting with the method in the second homework, however, we ended up with \n",
      "areas (leaves in the hierarchical partitioning) that we oddly shapped - wide rectangles \n",
      "that encompassed areas of the world that would have very diverse climate, for example \n",
      "would span from Australia to southern Africa. To remedy this, we decided to perform a \n",
      "*preliminary partitioning* of the world into areas of fixed width (we experimented with \n",
      "squared shaped areas mostly). Here is an example of how this preliminary partitioning \n",
      "looks like:\n",
      "\n",
      "![preliminary partition](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15585964/BigDataReportImages/prelim.png \"Partition\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Areas for which we had no or very little data have been excluded, hence the blank areas on \n",
      "the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once this preliminary partitioning was fixed, we ran the k-d-tree algorithm, explained \n",
      "earlier, on each one of these areas. Note at this point that the main invariant that we \n",
      "started off with, namely that the leaf nodes need to have about the same weight, does not\n",
      "necessarily hold now. Indeed you would expect a fixed size area in the U.S. to be much \n",
      "*heavier* than an area in the Sahara. Therefore, we tried to carefully pick the level to \n",
      "which we would run the k-d-tree algorithm in each one of these areas. To that end, the level \n",
      "for each area is proportional to the logarithm of its weight. Therefore, we would expect \n",
      "finer partitioning in the U.S than the Sahara, for example. Here is what this partioning \n",
      "looks like:\n",

      "for space efficiency is based on the *Minimum Description Length* (*MDL*) criterion. Put\n",

      "requires $k_1$ ($k_2$) vectors to reach $85\\%$ of the variance, for example. The combined \n",
      "region contains $n_3 = n_1 + n_2$ measurements and requires $k_3$ vectors to reach $85\\%$ \n",
      "of the variance. $k_3$ is computed by first computing the covariance matrix for the merged \n",
      "region and then doing PCA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final form of the citerion is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$n_1 * k_1 + (k_1 + 1) * 365 + n_2 * k_2 + (k_2 + 1) * 365 > n_3 * k_3 + (k_3 + 1) * 365 $$\n",

However, we can see that the figure of 10 years average does not show clearly the temperature increase, not as we showed for these 5 stations. The reason is that these 5 stations are near the city, and all 801 stations will include a lot stations which isn't located near city (some of them are in the snow mountain...) \n",
